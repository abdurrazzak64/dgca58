                                        <p class="text_center">“Promoting ICAO Gender Equality Programme in conjunction with <br>
                                            Next Generation of Aviation Professionals (NGAP) initiative”. </p>

                                        <p>
                                            ICAO established a Gender Equality Programme with the primary aim of facilitating and coordinating targeted Programmes and Projects to enable progress toward the aspirational goal of gender equality by 2030. The Assembly Resolution A39-30 had a clear focus on Professional and higher levels of employment, within ICAO and within States and the global aviation sector. To advance gender equality in line with the Assembly Resolution, a strong commitment from Member States, Industry other Global Stakeholders are critical to the long-term success of ICAO Programme.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
