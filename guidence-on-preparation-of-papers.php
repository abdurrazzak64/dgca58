It should be noted that ICAO APAC Contributory Bodies such as the RASG-APAC, APANPIRG, RASCF and their affiliated bodies provide the most appropriate forum to deliberate on matters of specific technical nature in view of the presence of relevant subject matter experts in those fora, therefore it is strongly recommended that submission of Discussion Papers with such contents to the DGCA Conference be avoided to the extent possible.

The Regional Office would select papers for presentation bearing in mind the time allocated to each session. Only Discussion Papers would be taken up for presentation while the Information Papers, which often provide valuable materials, should continue to be encouraged, but only for the information of delegations.

It should be noted that ICAO APAC Contributory Bodies such as the RASG-APAC, APANPIRG, RASCF and their affiliated bodies provide the most appropriate forum to deliberate on matters of specific technical nature in view of the presence of relevant subject matter experts in those fora, therefore it is strongly recommended that submission of Discussion Papers with such contents to the DGCA Conference be avoided to the extent possible.

Some Information Papers explain progress in promoting ICAO policies and/or provisions.

                                                        Timely distribution of the papers is particularly important in the case of Discussion Papers so that the matters raised can be given due consideration by the delegates. All papers received by the specified deadline will be posted in pdf format on the website established by the Host State for the purpose of this Conference. Every effort is made by the Host Organizing Committee and the Secretariat to make papers available to participating delegates prior to the Conference.

                                                        On the question of selection of papers, the Directors General of Civil Aviation, during the 42<sup>nd</sup> Conference also decided that it should be left to the ICAO Regional Office. The Regional Office would select papers for presentation bearing in mind the time allocated to each session. Only Discussion Papers would be taken up for presentation while the Information Papers, which often provide valuable materials, should continue to be encouraged, but only for the information of delegations.
